In the spring behavior design panel, the user can add different joint design by checking the ratio button. The user can parameterize each joint design in a graphical interface. On the right side of the figure, from top to bottom, it shows the workflows of all three panels. For the top spring generation panel, the user can first select the model body, then generate the spring, and can change the spring length. With spring stiffness control panel, the user can drag the bar to make the change and the new spring with updated stiffness is rendered in the Rhino modeling scene. With the spring behavior design panel, the user can add a joint to the model and the join is rendered in red in the model.

Finally, the right side of the figure shows the training stage.', 'Fig.2  A complex flowchart of the detailed pipeline as described in Section 4.3. The upper part of the flow chart described the procedure of feature selection, rule mining and rule selection (applied on common rules and unique rules respectively.) of the RuleGenerateSet. Then, the output rules are applied on the TrainTestSet to extract contextually filtered features for machine learning training.  The rule selection and the contextually filtered features are the key contributions of this paper.', 'This is a screenshot of the virtual kirana store. On the left side is a thin light blue sidebar with two items and their price: biscuits for rupees 15 and choco for rupees 35. At the bottom of the side bar there is text that reads- bill rupees 50. In the center is the virtual store with two brown wooden shelves and a wooden table in front of them. The top shelf has eggs for rupees 20, milk for ruppes 20, sliced brown bread of rupees 15 and yogurt for rupees 15. The lower shelf only has a bag of chips for rupees 10 and butter for rupees 30. The table has two items on its left: one packet of chocolate biscuits for rupees 15 and one bar of chocolate for rupees 35.All the items, except eggs, are from brands commonly available in India. On the rigth side is a thin yellow sidebar which has Indian curreny / money placed on it. From the top, there is one 50 rupees note, 20 rupees note, 10 rupees note which is selected by an onscreen hand cursor so that this note is about 40% bigger in size than the other notes. Under the 10 rupees note is a 5 rupees note and finally a 5 rupee coin and 10 rupee coin. At the bottom of the side bar there is text that reads- total is rupees 100.', 'The bar graph consists of the math scores from 0 to 10 on the y axis with participants on the x axis. For each participant, her pre and post test math score and post test math) is displayed. The solid blue bar is the pre test score and the lined blue bar is the post test math score. For P1 the pre test score is 9.5 and post test is 8, for P2, both pre and post scrores are 5, for P3 pre test score is 4.5 and post test is 6, for P4 pre test score is 8.5 and post is 7, for P5 and P6 pre test score is 6 and post 7, for P7 both pre test and post are 7, for P8 both pre and post test are 6, for P9 pre test is 6 and post 6.5, for P10 pre test is 3 and post is 8, for P11 pre test is 4.5 and post is 7.5, for P12 pre test is 3 and post is 6 , for P13 pre is 3 and post 5, for P14 pre is 8 and post is 7.5, for P15 pre is 8 and post is 6.5, for P16 pre is 5 and post is 6.5, for P17 pre is 8 and post is 9 and for P18, pre is 7.5 and post is 8.', 'A line chart showing the average accuracies of the different modes for the Bar Chart task. The first session is the lowest and then the lines tend to increase. The fifth session has a large drop in accuracy for the silent and verbal modes. The Silent and Verbal lines tend to be similar and the Finger Pointing line is higher in the last three sessions. There is a single point for the Braille modes in session six which is between Silent and Verbal Modes and below Finger Pointing.', 'A line chart showing the average time it took participants on all tasks. The y-axis of the chart is time in seconds (ranges from 0 to 60), the x-axis of the chart is session number (ranges from 1 to 6). There is a line for the three modes: Silent, Verbal and Finger Pointing. They all appear to be going down, but there is a big spike in the Verbal mode line at session 4. In general, the Finger Pointing mode is the highest (takes the most time), the Silent mode is next and the Verbal takes the least amount of time, although in the fourth and sixth sessions, the Verbal line is above the Silent one. There is a dot corresponding to the Braille mode at Session 6, it is between the Verbal and Silent modes.', 'Three column charts are shown horizontally. The first chart is labelled "Complexity of Haptic w/ Visual" and has shows decreasing utility moving right from Simple, to Tacton, to none.    The second chart is labelled Sound characteristics and shows decreasing utility moving right, from Identity, to Direction, to Loudness.     The last chart, labelled filtering options, shows decreasing utility moving from Identity to Direction to Loudness.', 'Three column charts are shown horizontally.
