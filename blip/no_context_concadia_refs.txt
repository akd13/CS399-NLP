Graph of the difference between Vieta's approximation for the smaller of the two roots of the quadratic equation x squared plus b x plus c equals zero compared with the value calculated using the quadratic formula. The difference is plotted as a function of b for two different values of c, c equals 4, and c equals 400,000. The graph is a log log graph, with the vertical axis, the difference, ranging from ten to the minus 13 at the bottom to ten to the minus 1 at the top. The horizontal axis, b, ranges from 10 at the left to ten to the eighth at the right. Vieta's approximation for the smaller root is not accurate for small b but is accurate for large b. The direct evaluation of the smaller root using the quadratic formula is accurate for small b with roots of comparable value, but experiences loss of significance errors for large b and widely spaced roots. When c equals 4, Vieta's approximation starts off poorly at the left, but gets better with larger b, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaching a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the fifth. Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula then start diverging again because the quadratic formula experiences loss of significance error. When c equals four hundred thousand, the difference between Vieta's approximation and the quadratic formula reaches a minimum at approximately b equals ten to the seventh. The curves are both straight to the left of the minimum, indicating a simple monomial power relationship between the difference and b.
