20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn26.png," Handguns are the most common weapon type used in mass shootings in the United States, with a total of 143 different handguns being used in 95 incidents between 1982 and February 2020. These figures are calculated from a total of 118 reported cases over this period, meaning handguns are involved in over 80 percent of mass shootings. ","The involvement of semi-automatic rifles in mass shootings Owing to their use in several high-profile mass shootings, there has been much public discussion over suitability or necessity of assault weapons for the purpose of self-defense. While any definition of assault weapon is contentious, semi-automatic rifles are generally the main focus of debates around this issue. Since 1985 there has been a known total 47 mass shootings involving rifles, mostly semi-automatics. This figure is underreported though, as it excludes the multiple semi-automatic (and fully automatic) rifles used in the 2017 Las Vegas Strip massacre â€?the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, killing 58 and wounding 546. In fact, semi-automatic rifles were featured in four of the five deadliest mass shootings, being used in the Orlando nightclub massacre, Sandy Hook Elementary massacre and Texas First Baptist Church massacre. Mass shootings and gun control Despite evidence of strict gun control measures reducing the frequency and severity of mass shootings in countries like Australia, citizens in the United States remain deeply divided over the issue. According to a survey about the expected impact of gun laws on the number of mass shootings, a slim majority of Americans believe that gun control measures will have little-to-no effect. Most likely, this opinion is influenced by an underlying commitment among many in the U.S. to the greater importance of protecting gun ownership rights than limiting access to firearms. This sits in sharp contrast to many other developed countries. For example, most Canadians support a ban on civilian owned firearms.

","Bentonite â€?additional informationBentonite is an absorbent aluminum phyllosilicate clay which is frequently generated from the alteration of volcanic ash. It consists predominantly of montmorillonite, a clay mineral. In 1898, Bentonite was first discovered in 1898 and classified in Fort Benton, Wyoming. Bentonite products have properties which give them a wide and diverse range of uses and applications. Its ability to expand in water is one of its most important properties, giving bentonite its voluminous and gelatinous mass. There are several different types of bentonite, such as, sodium bentonite, calcium bentonite and potassium bentonite. Sodium and calcium bentonites are primarily used for various industrial purposes. In iron and steel production processes, bentonite is widely used as a binding agent. For example, sodium bentonite is commonly used for large castings while calcium bentonite is more often used for smaller castings. The United States was one of the key producers of bentonite in 2016, followed by China and Greece. In 2019, the U.S. exported around 820 thousand metric tons of bentonite to other countries.Another common use of bentonite is as a cat litter, due to its advantage of absorbing refuse by forming clumps and leaving the rest of the product for further use.

And sizable minorities of both groups say they’d be dismayed if someone from the “other side” were to marry into their family.
And when given the choice, three-quarters of consistent conservatives say they’d prefer to live in a community of larger houses with more space between them, even if that means having to drive to shops, restaurants and other amenities.

","Population of Canada Canada ranks second among the largest countries in the world in terms of area size, right behind Russia, despite having a relatively low total population. The reason for this is that most of Canada remains uninhabited due to inhospitable conditions. Approximately 90 percent of all Canadians live within about 160 km of the U.S. border because of better living conditions and larger cities. On a year to year basis, Canadaâ€™s total population has continued to increase, although not dramatically.

At this time, Qatar, with an index value of 0.31, was the safest country in the world. In the framework of the WorldRiskIndex, disaster risk is analyzed as a complex interplay of natural hazards and social, political and environmental factors. Unlike current approaches that focus strongly on the analysis of the various natural hazards, the WorldRiskIndex, in addition to exposure analysis, focuses on the vulnerability of the population, i.e. its susceptibility, its capacities to cope with and to adapt to future natural events as well as the consequences of climate change. Disaster risk is seen as a function of exposure and vulnerability. The national states are the frame of reference for the analysis. The index consists of indicators in four components: exposure to natural hazards such as earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts and sea level rise; susceptibility as a function of public infrastructure, nutrition and the general economic framework; coping capacities as a function of governance, medical services and economic security; and adaptive capacities to future natural events and climate change.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn7745.png,"Although adult English/Spanish bilingual Latinos have some proficiency in speaking both English and Spanish, they tend to use the languages differently depending on the setting. English is far and away the dominant language of U.S. commerce and trade, and dominates U.S. workplaces. English/Spanish bilingual Latinos report that they largely speak English in the workplace. About 60% of bilingual Hispanic workers usually speak more English than Spanish at work (29%), or use only English at work (33%). Widespread Spanish language usage at work is relatively rare among bilingual workers. About one in ten report speaking “more Spanish than English” or “only Spanish” at work (see Figure 3).
English/Spanish bilingual Hispanics seem to be markedly different from the wider Hispanic adult population in their mass media preferences. The survey asked respondents whether they typically received news (via TV or radio) in English or Spanish. Almost 40% of all Latino adults said either “only Spanish” or “more Spanish than English,” reflecting the usage patterns of Latino adults with little speaking ability in English. Bilingual Latinos extensively use English to obtain news broadcasts, as Figure 3 illustrates. Nearly five in ten bilingual Hispanics hear news in “English only” or “more English than Spanish.” Less than a fifth reported obtaining news in “only Spanish” or “more Spanish than English.” So the preponderance of bilingual speaking Latinos either obtains news in English, or does not express an exclusive preference for hearing news in Spanish.
At home English/Spanish speaking Latinos are about evenly divided in their use of Spanish and English (see Figure 3). About a third either speaks more Spanish than English (17%) or only speaks Spanish at home (17%). And, about a third speaks more English than Spanish (21%) or only English at home (12%).

20230304_152148,5,statista43.png," In 2015, when Activision Blizzard last reported on World of Warcraft's subscriptions, the game had 5.5 million global subscribers. It is projected that the numbers will gradually decrease to hit 4.46 million in 2023. The game reached the peak of its popularity in the second half of 2010, when Activision Blizzardâ€™s estimates put the global number of WoW subscribers at 12 million. Before that, the number had been climbing steadily from 1.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, before exceeding five million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2011, the figures started falling and, by the first quarter of 2014, they decreased to the 2006 level. The predicted fall in numbers may be attributed to the fact that the game is now over 15 years old and that new online game modes, such as battle royale, have grown in popularity in recent years. The player count of Fortnite , for example, reached 350 million users worldwide in 2020. ","What is World of Warcraft?

The fifth expansion pack - â€œWarlords of Draenorâ€?â€?appeared on the market in fall 2014 and, wthin the first day of its release, it sold 3.3 million copies worldwide, as did the sixth expansion - Legion. The main appeal of the series is the possibility for players to transform into many different creatures, so-called races.

Three Scandinavian countries occupied the top three places in terms of the share of WoW's player base, with Sweden accounting for 19.6 percent of the WoW core gamer player base.

Part of the social platformâ€™s appeal is the ability of users to follow any other user with a public profile, enabling users to interact with celebrities who regularly post on the social media site. Currently, the most-followed person on Twitter is singer Katy Perry with more than 107 million followers. Twitter has also become an important communications channel for governments and heads of state â€?U.S. President Donald Trump was the most-followed world leader on Twitter, followed by Pope Francis and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Despite the widespread usage among the rich and famous, the decline in active users has not been impressing investors as the platform is largely reliant on delivering advertising to users in order to generate revenues. Twitterâ€™s company revenue in 2018 amounted to three billion U.S. dollars, up from 2.44 billion in the preceding fiscal year. Twitter was only recently able to report a positive annual result for the first time, when the company generated 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in net income in 2018.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn2479.png,"Researchers were able to match a very high percentage of panelists from the nationally representative survey sample to at least one of the five commercial voter files, suggesting that the files collectively cover a large share of the U.S. population. Depending on the voter file vendor, the percentage of panelists matched varied from a low of 50% to a high of 79%, with an average match rate of 69%. Less than half (42%) of the panelists were located in all five files, but each of the vendors “found” panelists missed by other vendors. Differences among the vendors are largely a function of their tolerance for mismatches and, presumably, the success of their matching algorithms. Collectively, the vendors successfully matched 91% of panelists, meaning that more than nine-in-ten panelists could be found on at least one of the files and just 9% of panelists could not be found on any of the files. The relatively high level of coverage of the files is encouraging for researchers and campaigns that use them for targeting, messaging or research. Of course, most clients using these voter files will not have purchased all five of them, so match rates of 90% and higher may be difficult if not impossible to achieve with any single file.
Still, commercial voter files may disproportionately miss segments of the public who are politically disengaged, younger, Hispanic and more mobile. Specifically, the likelihood of finding an individual on a commercial voter file was strongly related to whether they were registered to vote. On average across the five vendors, 77% of people who said they were registered to vote were matched. Only 38% of the self-described unregistered voters were matched. Similarly, match rates varied greatly by panelists’ age, race and ethnicity. Only about one-in-five younger panelists (22% of those ages 18 to 29) were found in all five files, as compared to more than half (59%) of older panelists (ages 65 and older). Similarly, just 26% of Hispanics were found in all five files, compared with 47% of non-Hispanic whites. 2 Mobility is also a strong correlate. Only 14% of those who reported moving in the last year were found on all five files. Those who reported living at their residence for longer matched at a much higher rate.","Hispanics, panelists the likely young, and more mobile  | panelists less likely to be found on the  | voter files  | % ofeach group that matches to  | o files 1 file 2-4 files All 5 files  | Total 9 9  | 41  | 42  | Men 9 11  | 43  | 38  | Women 8 8  | 39  | 45  | 18-29 18 16  | 44  | 22  | 30-49 9 9  | 39  | 42  | 50-64 5 9  | 39  | 47  | 65+ 24  | 36  | 59  | White 8  | 41  | 47  | Black 10 10  | 37  | 43  | Hispa nic  | 23  | 12  | 40  | 26  | College+  | 40  | 48  | Some col 8 9  | 42  | 42  | HS or less  | 13  | 40  | 36  | Family income  | $75 000  | 38  | 52  | $30K-$74. .999 8  | 40  | 45  | <$30 000 14 11  | 43  | 31  | Time at current address  | 1year or less 14 14  | 58  | 14  | 1-2 years 11  | 46  | 31  | 3-4 years 12 36  | 4.5  | 5 yee rsor longer 5 8  | 35  | 52  | Note: Among active panelists who provideda name Weighted.  | ""Commercial Voter Files and the Study ofU.S. Politics Weighted.  | PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","The Pew Research Center ’ s results of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the United States , 67 % of respondents say that they are somewhat likely to be “ completely rebuilt ” for the Pew Research Center survey conducted ."

There were 960 M&A deals in Asia in June 2015. ,"Mergers and acquisitions in Asia No one could deny the force behind the momentum of the Asian market and its growing prominence in the area of global M&A. As governments in this highly populated part of the world continue to embrace the capitalist market system, hundreds upon hundreds of millions of new consumers are entering the market, ready to be targeted by the industries who want them to buy their products. This highly lucrative market has managed to hold the attention of firms both local and international looking to get in on mergers and acquisitions. M&A is set to play a pivotal role in the restructuring of a wide array of industries in Asia, reflected in the high M&A deal volume in Asia presented in this statistic. Through the restructure of industry which can be achieved by M&A, the level of competitiveness in this bustling market will increase. Despite the general high figures and high M&A deal volume in Asia in this time period, the general trend seems to be ebbing towards a declining rate as 2013 progresses. This is most likely due to the fact that the majority of mergers and acquisitions taking place in Asia have been in the pharmaceutical industry and it is this very industry that the rate has been slowing. This slow down is mostly due to the fact that it has been pre-occupied of late with the consolidation of transactions from the previous year, as well as being slightly more cautious with funds, reserving them for the volatile business environment. ","This statistic shows the market share of mergers and acquisitions in Asia Pacific by region in 2019 . That year , the United States was the largest global M & A deals in the world , with a market share of 20 percent ."

This represented a decrease of approximately 7,600 pubs in the last ten years, and over 13,600 pubs since 2000. ","Pubs in decline Several factors have been suggested for the decline in pubs in the UK. Public houses, once considered an important pillar of British communities, have faced several challenges related to changing consumer behavior. The 2007 indoor smoking ban and rising alcohol prices deterred people from drinking in pubs, sparking a trend in â€˜pre-loadingâ€?on cheap supermarket-bought alcohol before going out. Socializing at home has also become more common place thanks to developments in technology and home entertainment. Not to mention younger generations are drinking less, with more 16-24-year olds choosing to not drink alcohol at all. Trends and impact of COVID-19 For an industry already struggling with closures, the COVID-19 pandemic only added to the burden. A lockdown in March forced pubs to close their doors, and although many were able to resume business in August, a second lockdown has sparked fears that it could be the final straw for thousands of pubs and brewers. Still, pubs remain at the heart of British culture. Pubs focusing on food have become increasingly popular in line with other dining trends, and overall suffered fewer closures compared to typical bars. Trends in craft beer also gave pubs a boost, with new drink assortments and microbreweries catering to different tastes.

Forecasts by the IMF expect a decline in GDP growth to 1.85 percent in 2020 due to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, and GDP growth of 8.24 percent in 2021. ","Real GDP growth The current gross domestic product is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. It refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. When analyzing year-on-year changes, the current GDP is adjusted for inflation, thus making it constant. Real GDP growth is regarded as a key indicator for economic growth as it incorporates constant GDP figures. As of 2019, China was among the leading countries with the largest gross domestic product worldwide, second only to the United States which had a GDP volume of almost 21.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

For example, when P2 attempted to change the color of the triangle in task #16 (referenced in Figure 1 and Figure 12), she selected the ""Shape Fill"" button, which flls the selected shape with a default color or can be opened as a dropdown menu to choose more colors (see Figure 12a). When she clicked the button, it flled her triangle with the default color (orange) without announcing the change, and switched focus from the menu back to her triangle (see Figure 12b). P2 was confused and navigated back to the Shape Fill button and clicked it again, and it switched focus back to her triangle once more, prompting her to voice confusion and frustration: “What? Why won’t it do ... It won’t let me get into ...” She tried a key command, which silently switched focus to the artboard and opened a “Format Background” task pane with a dropdown fll button, which she used to select a shade of red that was applied to the artboard, leaving her with an orange triangle and a red artboard (see Figure 12c). After reading through the other formatting options in the task pane and noticing they referred to the “background,” she switched keyboard focus and found that it switched to the triangle, which she had thought she already had focus on. At that point, she decided to end the task, saying, “Uh, I tried. Did not know if it worked, or if I made the whole slide red. [laughs] I did what I could, I don’t know what else I can do.”",This statistic shows the results of a survey conducted in the United States .

20230304_152148,5,statista2488.png," Video gaming giant, Electronic Arts, generated net revenue of over three billion U.S. dollars in its 2020 fiscal year. This marks a huge increase on the revenue compared to the previous year. This sharp growth in revenues is no doubt in part due to the coronavirus pandemic, which spread across the world at the beginning of 2020 and led to many people turning to gaming and other forms of indoor entertainment during periods of lockdown. ","EA revenue Founded in 1982, EA was one of the first companies to explore the idea of home computer games and, in the ensuing decades, has been responsible for legendary game franchises such as FIFA, Madden NFL, and The Sims. The company generated net revenue of 4.95 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, over two million U.S. dollars of which was generated in North America. Given that EA is known for its wide range of console games, it is no surprise that the company generates most of its revenue from console gaming â€?approximately 3.33 billion U.S. dollars of revenue was generated in this segment in 2019, whilst all of the other segments generated less than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars combined. However, in the age of mobile gaming where people want to play games wherever and whenever, EA has seen its mobile revenue more than double since 2014. EAâ€™s future Despite its reputation as a gaming giant, EA cannot afford to rest on its laurels with so many other players entering the gaming world. The company spent 702 million U.S. dollars on marketing and sales expenditures in 2019, marking a slight increase on the previous yearâ€™s figure. With future releases including the new editions of the FIFA and Madden series, as well as a new Star Wars game emerging in late 2019, the next few years look to be vital in determining EAâ€™s future success.

","Additional information on fatalities in the Iraq War The invasion of Iraq by the United States and coalition forces in March 2003 saw the beginning of the Iraq War, a conflict that would continue beyond the end of the decade. Fatalities of American forces were highest in the first five years of conflict as soldiers grappled with the Al Qaeda as well as civil war between those groups seeking to fill the power vacuum left by the removal of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Casualties progressively decreased from 2008, in part due to attempts by Barack Obama who made the removal of troops from Iraq a central promise of this successful campaign to succeed George W. Bush. In 2013, the majority of Americans considered sending troops to fight in Iraq to be a mistake. While the number of civilian deaths in the Iraq War was much higher, the trend of numbers decreasing from 2008 onward was in line with the trend for American solider loses. However, civilian deaths rose again from 2013 onward as Iraq returned to heavy conflict with Islamic State. The high number of American fatalities in the first five years of the Iraq War could be seen as influencing the reluctance of the United States to commit ground troop support in the battle against Islamic State when the issue was discussed in 2015. Not only is the loss of life a tragedy in itself, but the political discourse in the United States surrounding the involvement of their troops in Middle Eastern conflicts has made further involvement unattractive to elected officials. However calls for further ground support are likely to continue as Iraq remained in the top three countries with the most terrorist attacks as of 2018.

By comparison, the perpetrator was African American in 20 mass shootings, and Latino in 10. When calculated as percentages, this amounts to 55 percent, 18 percent and eight percent respectively. ","Race of mass shooters reflects the U.S. population Broadly speaking, the racial distribution of mass shootings mirrors the racial distribution of the U.S. population as a whole. While a superficial comparison of the statistics seems to suggest African American shooters are over-represented and Latino shooters underrepresented, the fact that the shooterâ€™s race is unclear in around five percent of cases, along with the different time frames over which these statistics are calculated means no such conclusions should be drawn. Conversely, looking at the mass shootings in the United States by gender clearly demonstrates that the majority of mass shootings are carried out by men. Mass shootings and mental health With no clear patterns between the socio-economic or cultural background of mass shooters, increasing attention has been placed on mental health. Analysis of the factors Americans considered to be to blame for mass shootings showed 80 percent of people felt the inability of the mental health system to recognize those who pose a danger to others was a significant factor. This concern is not without merit â€?in over half of the mass shootings since 1982, the shooter showed prior signs of mental health issues, suggesting improved mental health services may help deal with this horrific problem. Mass shootings and guns In the wake of multiple mass shootings, critics have sought to look beyond the issues of shooter identification and their influences by focusing on their access to guns. The study mentioned above showed 61 percent of Americans felt the easy access to firearms was to blame by either a â€œgreat dealâ€?or a â€œfair amountâ€?for mass shootings. Gun control takes on a particular significance when the uniquely American phenomenon of school shootings is considered. The annual number of incidents involving firearms at K-12 schools in the U.S. was over 100 in both 2018 and 2019. Conversely, similar incidents in other developed countries exceptionally rare, with only five school shootings in G7 countries other than the U.S. between 2009 and 2018.

For infants below the age of one year, smallpox was responsible for between 15 and 30 percent of all deaths in the given regions, as many of these babies had not yet been vaccinated and were at a high risk of succumbing to the virus. In states where the vaccination of infants was not compulsory, such as the Netherlands, Berlin (Prussia) and Leipzig (Saxony), the share of deaths due to smallpox among young children remained high, while it was relatively low in Hesse and Scotland, who had introduced mandatory vaccination in 1815 and 1864 respectively. ","Great Pandemic highlights the need for revaccination As Hesse had been vaccinating on a large scale for generations, the share of smallpox deaths was relatively low among young people; however, between 1870 and 1872, over half of all deaths among those aged 30 to 60 years were due to smallpox. The reason for this was because smallpox vaccination in infancy did not guarantee lifelong protection, therefore immunity often wore off in adulthood. In the 1830s and 1840s, several German armies started to vaccinate new recruits regardless of whether they had been vaccinated in infancy or not; when scientists compared the smallpox death rates in the army with that of the civilian population during this pandemic, they noticed that it was much lower in the army, due to these revaccination policies. This discovery helped many scientists in Europe recognize the need for revaccination, which greatly contributed to the eradication of the disease across most of Europe in the early twentieth century.

Any organization that accepts or spends more than 2,600 U.S. dollars in order to influence a federal election is considered to be a PAC and must register as such. Super PACs were born as a result of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court decision which overturned provisions in the McCain-Feingold Act. This allowed unions and corporations to be able to make indirect contributions to support or oppose political campaigns. Both PACs must list their donors publicly.

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn4970.png," The javelin throw was added to the men's Summer Olympic roster in the 1908 Olympic Games in London, while the women's event first appeared in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. As with the discus throw, the javelin appeared in the Ancient Olympic Games, and was contested in two formats; measuring distance and accuracy. The sport was then resurrected in Germany and Scandinavia in the 1870s, and gradually developed into it's current format, with two-handed and freestyle variations of the event passing out of popularity by the 1920s. Today, the restrictions on the javelins are 800 grams in weight and between 2.6 and 2.7 meters in length for men, and 600 grams in weight and between 2.2 and 2.3 meters in length for women. In contrast to other throwing events, there are strict guidelines for the technique used to throw the javelin, as certain experimental and freestyle methods used in the 1950s were seen as a danger to the audience. ","Evolution of the javelin Originally, contestants threw wooden poles (usually made from birch wood) that were fitted with a metal tip. In the 1950s, two brothers from the United States, Bud and Dick Held, developed the Held Javelin, which revolutionized the sport. The Held Javelin had a hollow wooden shaft (later variations were made completely of metal) and flew further than solid wooden javelins. Unfortunately these javelins were less likely to land point first, which created difficulties when measuring distances. Further developments allowed competitors to throw javelins further than ever before, and by 1984 the world record for men had reached 104.8 meters; a distance that created problems for organizers as it was becoming increasingly unsafe to host javelin events in stadiums. In 1986, a number of measures were taken to reposition the javelin's center of gravity, to forbid the use of special paints of holes that would affect aerodynamics, and to increase the likelihood of the javelin landing in the ground. Records Due to these restrictions and modifications, all records set before 1986 were nullified. Today, the men's Olympic record is 90.57 meters, and was set by Sweden's Andreas Thorkildsen in 2008, while the women's Olympic record of 71.53 meters was set by Cuba's Osleidys MenÃ©ndez in 2004. The world records were both set by Czech athletes; Jan Å½eleznÃ½ set the men's record with a distance of 98.48 meters in 1996, and Barbora Å potÃ¡kovÃ¡ threw 72.28 meters in 2008 to set the women's record. Jan Å½eleznÃ½ is also the only Olympian to win three gold medals in the javelin throw, between 1992 and 2000, while three other men and two women have claimed back-to-back golds in the event. Historically, Scandinavian countries have been the most successful in this event, with Finland taking seven golds in the men's event, although German women have won the most medals, with a combined tally of five golds and 18 overall medals.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn5219.png,"Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolás Maduro is no fan of the U.S., but that doesn’t mean Venezuelans take the same view. According to Pew Research Center’s Spring 2014 global survey, Venezuelans have generally positive attitudes concerning the U.S. At a rate of two-to-one, the Venezuelan public holds a more favorable (62%) than unfavorable (31%) view of their biggest trade partner. This represents a nine point uptick in support since 2013, when 53% shared positive feelings toward the U.S. Younger Venezuelans are especially likely to view the U.S. favorably – 66% of those ages 18-29 express a positive opinion. Still, a majority of those ages 50 and older (56%) also perceive the U.S. favorably.
The biggest disagreements about the U.S. break along ideological lines. Venezuelans who lean to the right of the political spectrum see the U.S. in an overwhelmingly positive light (84%), while only 12% have a negative opinion. Venezuela’s political left, which aligns with President Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela, tends to be more critical of the U.S. (62% unfavorable v. 34% favorable). This is none too surprising given the tumultuous relationship between Maduro and the U.S. in recent months and the many years of tension between Washington and Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Chávez, who blamed the U.S. for organizing a coup against him in 2002, often stoked anti-American sentiment with colorful quips, including claims that the U.S. “invented technology to spread cancer” to South American leaders and referring to then-President George W. Bush as “the devil,” “a donkey” and “a drunkard.” Despite this, a majority of moderates (63%) see America favorably.
Meanwhile, most Venezuelans have a negative opinion of Venezuela’s political and economic ally, Cuba. The two countries have a very interdependent relationship, with Venezuela sending Cuba subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban doctors, teachers and military advisors. Yet 57% of Venezuelans give Cuba an unfavorable rating, with fully 38% saying they have a very unfavorable impression of their trade partner. Only 37% have a favorable outlook.
The most notable difference of opinion hinges on political ideology. While roughly seven-in-ten (72%) left-leaning Venezuelans view Cuba favorably, only 14% on the right share this attitude. Moderates also tend to be more disapproving of Cuba (34% favorable v. 54% unfavorable). Protestors in Caracas earlier this year, lauded by opposition groups in both Venezuela and Cuba, attributed such feelings to the perceived “Cubanization” of Venezuela, claiming that the Cuban government increasingly plays a role in Venezuelan efforts to suppress dissidents and wants to force Cuba’s strict socialist ideas onto Venezuelans.","Ideology U.S., a Factor in Venezuelan Views  | Ideology of U.S., Cuba  | Favorable views of by ideology  | U.S.  | TOTAL  | 62%  | Left  | 34  | Moderate  | 63  | Right  | 84  | Cuba  | TOTAL  | Left  | Moderate  | 34  | Right  | 14  | Source: Global Attitudes Spring 2014 survey.

Moreover, a closer look at the sector reveals that some of the leading Italian companies earn up to 96 percent of their total turnover outside of the domestic market.

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn3366.png," The first day of the First Battle of the Somme is acknowledged as being the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army. Taking place during the First World War from July 1, to November 18, 1916, it was one of the most costly and devastating battles in human history, and the first day alone saw approximately 70 thousand casualties. The offensive took place on the morning of July 1, after seven days of heavy bombardment from British artillery. Artillery was supposed to clear a path through the maze of German wire that covered no mans land, as well as to suppress the German forces and disrupt their supply routes. ","Heavy casualties in the initial attack The British forces of over 100 thousand men, which also included soldiers from Ireland, Canada, South Africa and India, rushed the German lines early on the first day. The week-long artillery bombardment did not have its desired effect, as they could not damage much of the German trenches (which were fifteen meters deep in many areas) and much of the wire remained intact, resulting in heavy casualties inflicted by German troops who were able to mobilize quickly and mow down the approaching forces with machine gun fire. By the end of the day, the British troops secured approximately 8 square kilometers of ground, along a front that stretched 24km (averaging just 0.33km from the initial line of attack), at a cost of 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 fatalities. In comparison, the German and French armies were of relatively similar sizes to that of the British, however their casualty rate was much much lower. Stalemate at Verdun The French, who were originally supposed to lead the attack, had redirected much of their efforts to Verdun, where they were locked in a deadly stalemate against German forces. This resulted in the British leading the charge at the Somme. Although the British penetrated the German lines and pushed them back, they paid for it with many lives, compared to the Germans who suffered between ten and twelve thousand casualties. This form of trench warfare set the precedent for the remainder of the battle, where the British and French made slow yet devastating progress against a German force who were able to entrench themselves and mobilize defenses much faster than the Allies could organize their attacks. By the end of the battle approximately 3 million men had taken part, resulting in over one million casualties.",This statistic shows the number of casualties in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2014 to the first half of the first half of 2019 .

Consistently, the president’s overall job approval ratings are more closely tied to evaluations of his handling of foreign policy and Iraq than any other issues, including the economy, the response to Hurricane Katrina, or terrorism policy. Put another way, nearly everyone who approves of the president’s performance in Iraq approves of his overall job performance, while nearly everyone who disapproves of how he’s handled Iraq disapproves overall as well. While this is the case with many evaluations of Bush’s job performance, the linkage is tightest when it comes to foreign policy and Iraq.
In this regard, Bush’s current standing in the polls, while affected by the public’s gloomy economic outlook and concerns about energy prices, immigration and the government’s response to Katrina, is anchored most directly to the situation in Iraq.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn7348.png,"The 2007 Pew survey found that in countries where people generally trust one another, there is also more confidence in the integrity of political leaders. As the figure below shows, the relationship between trust and corruption resembles the one between trust and crime. The percentage of people rating corrupt political leaders as a very big problem tends to be lower in countries that have high levels of trust such as Sweden, Canada, and Britain (the correlation coefficient is -.54). On the other hand, in nations such as Nigeria and Lebanon, trust is rare and concerns about political corruption are widespread.
Again, there are outliers. Kuwait is both a low trust and low corruption society. Indonesia is a high trust, high corruption country. And the Swedes are once again even less concerned about corruption than their high score on the trust measure would predict (the question about political corruption was not asked in China, the only country to top the Swedes on trust). Meanwhile, Americans — who have witnessed more than a few high profile political scandals over the last few years — were slightly more concerned about corrupt politicians than would have been expected, based on their reasonably high degree of social trust.
Eastern Europeans also tend to be more worried about corruption than one might anticipate given the level of social trust in the region. In all six Eastern European nations included on the survey, more than half say the issue of corrupt political leaders is a very important problem facing their country. Concern runs especially high in the Czech Republic, where nearly eight-in-ten (78%) see political corruption as a very important problem — only Nigerians express more concern about this issue.","Trust and Perceptions of Corruption  | S go I the I it go bi CONTERTARIZED  | 90  | North America  | Nigeria  | Latin imerica  | Czech Red,  | Western Europe  | Indonesia  | Lebanon  | Eastern Europe  | Peru  | Bulgaria  | Asia  | 70  | Poland  | Africa  | Middle East  | Chile  | Korea  | Morocco  | ULS  | 50  | Egypt  | Germany  | Kuwait  | 30  | canada  | Britain  | Sweden  | 10  | 20  | 30  | 40  | 50  | 60  | 70  | 80  | 90  | % Aloot Can Be Trusted ","This statistic shows the results of a survey , conducted in 2013 , according to the results of a survey conducted in November , according to the Pew Research Center survey conducted in November 2017 ."

This amount includes only retail drug spending, excluding nonretail. Estimations of drug spending can vary by investigating organization. For the U.S., among the most relevant drug spending calculations are provided by CMS, ASPE (Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation), and pharmaceutical market researcher IQVIA. ","High drug prices in the U.S. The United States is the country with the highest total drug spending and also with the highest per capita pharmaceuticals spending among developed countries. This is mostly connected to higher drug prices in the United States. For example, the price for blockbuster drug Humira was almost three times higher in the United States than in Germany in 2017. But whereas in other countries governments more or less directly control drug prices, the U.S. leaves drug pricing to market competition. As a consequence, the U.S. market is the most profitable for pharmaceutical companies. Where the money is spent Nearly half of all Americans have taken at least one prescription medicine within the preceding month. The therapeutic areas where spending is the highest are â€˜traditionallyâ€?to be found among antidiabetics, oncologics, autoimmune, and respiratory diseases. Based on number of prescriptions filled, antihypertensives, pain reliever, and mental health drugs are the leading classes.

Among renewable sources, hydropower ranked first, covering 16 percent of the total production, followed by biomass and solar energy. Nowadays, climate change seems to be one of the most challenging issues that national governments should be tackling. Energy transition is imperative and yet considering how static the energy sector can be, it is easy to foresee a long way ahead before reaching a complete replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources. ","Natural gas leading the energy transition in Italy The central role of natural gas and renewables in the Italian energy strategy can be also confirmed by looking back to the past few years. However, the share of production covered by renewable energy sources (RES) slightly decreased over time, while the percentage of electricity generated from natural gas kept on growing. As a matter of fact, the gross amount of energy produced from natural gas steadily increased between 2014 and 2017, and it nearly quadrupled compared to 1990. The potential of photovoltaic energy Scarce rainfall is to blame for the decrease registered in the electricity production from renewables between 2016 and 2017. As hydropower is the dominant renewable source of energy in the country due to infrastructural reasons, the waning in hydroelectric production has clearly affected the level of energy generation from RES. On the other hand, PV technology still played a crucial part in 2018, in terms of installed capacity and electricity production and it is expected to overtake hydropower by the end of 2030 .

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn3066.png,"A number of long-standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or stalled in 2016, as black voter turnout decreased, white turnout increased and the nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate remained flat since the 2012 election. Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau’s report, the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters.
The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6% in 2012. The 7-percentage-point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks. (It’s also the largest percentage-point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2% in 1992 to 60.7% in 1996.) The number of black voters also declined, falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016, representing a sharp reversal from 2012. With Barack Obama on the ballot that year, the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time. Among whites, the 65.3% turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1% in 2012.
The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6% in 2016, compared with 48.0% in 2012. Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long-awaited, historic surge in Latino voters. Due largely to demographic growth, the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016, up from 11.2 million in 2012. Even so, the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot, or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters, a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996. Meanwhile, the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3% in 2016, up from 46.9% in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996. Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics: Overall, about 5 million Asians voted in 2016, up from 3.8 million in 2012.
The number of naturalized-citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016, up from 9.3 million in 2012. In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign, turnout among naturalized-citizen voters (those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens) was 54.3%, up from 53.6% in 2012. Overall, the voter turnout rate among foreign-born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters, who had a 62.1% turnout rate in 2016. But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation’s two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed. In 2016, turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9%, compared with 44.9% for U.S.-born Asians. Among Hispanics, naturalized-citizen turnout was 53.4%, higher than the 45.5% turnout for U.S.-born Hispanics.","Black voter turnout state declined sharply in 2016,  | dropping below that of whites  | % of eligible voters who say they voted  | 75%  | 65. 3% White  | 65  | 59 6 Black  | 55  | 49. .3 Asian  | 47.6 Hispanic  | 45  | 1992  | 1996  | 2000  | 2004  | 2008  | 2012 2016  | 1988  | Note: Eligible voters are U.S citizens ages 18 and older.

Another 20% of parents say they have between 101 and 250 friends, while 23% have between 251 and 500 friends. Non-parents are more likely than parents to have very large Facebook networks — 16% of non-parent Facebook users have more than 500 Facebook friends, compared with 11% of parents.
Facebook networks are composed of a variety of people, not all of whom are necessarily considered close. Parents who use Facebook were asked how many of their friends on the platform they considered “actual friends.” A majority, 76%, said they considered between 0 and 100 of their Facebook friends “actual friends.” The typical parent reports a median of 50 “actual” Facebook friends, while the typical non-parent counts 40 of their Facebook friends as “actual” friends. As noted above, parents report having a median of 150 Facebook friends, and non-parents report having a median of 200 Facebook friends. Thus, a typical parent’s Facebook network is about one-third “actual” friends, while non-parents typically report that less than a quarter of their network is made up of actual friends.

However, with the industrial revolution and modern anthropological activities, the levels of these gases exceed in the atmosphere causing excessive heating.

20230304_152148,5,statista4098.png," In 2019, the national healthcare expenditure reached a value of more than 90 billion euros, equaling a year-on-year increase of roughly five percent. In a population of over 17 million people, this came to around 6,100 euros worth of Dutch health care expenses per capita. This figure was higher than those of other European countries. The per capita health expenditure of Italy, for example, stood at slightly over 2,500 euros in 2018, half that of the Netherlands. There are some who say, however, that this difference in health costs stems from how Dutch health insurance works. ","Dutch health insurance: one for all, all for one The Dutch health system combines private market elements with government supervision to make health care cost-efficient. Simply put, the Dutch government decides which care is covered by the mandatory â€œbasicâ€?health insurance. This can change every year and be influenced by politics. Therefore, health care in the Netherlands is accessible to (and paid for by) everybody, whether one uses it or not. This system is funded in three ways. First, there is a nominal annual premium of less than 1,450 euros (or 121 euros per month) that everybody pays, regardless of age or job situation. Second, some employers pay health care costs, depending on certain industries. Third, there is what is called eigen risico or â€œown riskâ€?â€excessâ€? This lump sum is compulsory from the age of 18 to pay before the basic health insurance starts reimbursing medical costs. In 2020, the value of this â€œverplichte eigen risicoâ€?was 385 euros. This is without counting the price a health insurance company might charge. Dutch health care: getting what one pays for The government decides the contents of the national health insurance package. Quality and pricing, however, are left to the health providers and health insurers. This is the other idea behind health care in the Netherlands: it should be accessible to all, but the free market is responsible for assuring quality and low costs. Dutch health care ranked as some of the best found in Europe, and the Dutch used it relatively often as can be seen in an overview of doctor visits in different European countries. ","This statistic depicts the health insurance market share for the health insurance market in Germany in 2019 . In the United Kingdom ( UK ) , the health insurance market is expected to grow by approximately 5.8 percent ."

20230304_152148,5,statista62.png," Boeingâ€™s 737 aircraft series have emerged as the companyâ€™s best sellers. The Boeing 737 twinjet is a shorter, more economical model similar to Boeingâ€™s 727 and 707. The Boeing 737-700, listed at an average price of just under 90 million U.S. dollars, is among the least expensive models, while the Boeing 777-9, priced at 442 million U.S. dollars, is among the most expensive ones on Boeing's price list. ","Leading aircraft manufacturers in the world Along with Airbus, Embraer, and Bombardier Aerospace, Boeing is one of the world's four largest aircraft manufacturers. In 2019, the Chicago-headquartered jet manufacturer did not manage to outperform its main competitor, Airbus: Boeing generated only 76.5 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, compared to the 78.9 billion U.S. dollars (or about 70.5 billion euros) revenue generated by Airbus. The competition between Boeing and Airbus has been intense over the years. Between 2003 and 2018, both companies have been receiving a somewhat comparable amount of orders. This changed drastically in 2019. Compared to Boeing, Airbus received five times the number of orders during that time period. The decline in gross orders of Boeing's aircraft In 2019, Boeing experienced a large slump in its business and financial performance. The traces of this declining performance goes back to the launching of its competitor Airbus 320 neo family with better fuel and operating efficiency, which was a comparably similar narrow-body aircraft to Boeing's 737 family. In response to this, Boeing quickly re-engineered 737 MAX family aircraft with more efficient engines and performance. However, the balance between absolute safety and cost-minimization was not kept thoroughly. In 2017, Boeing 737 MAX led to two fatal crashes taking 346 lives during Lion Air and Ethiopian Air flights. Consequently, all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft were grounded worldwide and Boeing lost a vital business trust. The demand for new Boeing aircraft declined significantly across the globe. The largest drop in Boeing aircraft deliveries was observed in East Asia, down from 223 aircraft in 2018 to 68 aircraft delivered by Boeing in 2019.

Residents of Maine have been able to take part in all U.S. presidential elections since 1789, although their votes were included in Massachusetts' total prior to Maine's admission to the union in 1820. Throughout most of its history, Maine was a staunchly Republican state, voting red in all but one elections between 1856 and 1960 (Maine and Vermont were the only states never to vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt), although it has (mostly) voted Democrat since 1992. ","Maine's population No U.S. president has ever been born in Maine, or resided there before taking office. The only major party candidate to have lived in Maine was James G. Blaine, who had represented Maine in both Houses of Congress before opposing Grover Cleveland in the 1884 election. Because of changing trends in the population and its density of the U.S., Maine is one of the few states whose allocation of electoral votes has decreased throughout most of its history. After admission to the union, Maine began with nine electoral votes (which was unusually high for a newly admitted state), and this number grew to ten in the 1930s; however, this number has gradually decreased over the past two centuries, and has stood at just four electoral votes since the 1960s. Maine's split Since 1972, Maine has split its four electoral votes between its two congressional districts; the winner of Maine's overall popular vote receives two votes, while the most popular candidate in each congressional district wins one electoral vote per district. While this system has been in place for almost fifty years, the 2016 election was the first time where the two districts voted for different candidates (the vote was also split in the 1828 election, however a different system was used and Maine was divided into more than two districts). The population of Maine's two congressional districts is fairly similar, although the first is much smaller in size and more urbanized than the second, which covers almost eighty percent of Maine's total land area and is one of the most rural districts in the country.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn2430.png,"In 2016, according to the World Bank, the average applied U.S. tariff across all products was 1.61%; that was about the same as the average rate of 1.6% for the 28-nation EU, and not much higher than Japan’s 1.35%. Among other major U.S. trading partners, Canada’s average applied tariff rate was 0.85%, China’s was 3.54% and Mexico’s was 4.36%. (Those average rates are weighted by product import shares with all of each nation’s trading partners, and don’t necessarily reflect the provisions of specific trade deals. Under NAFTA, for instance, most trade between the U.S., Canada and Mexico is duty-free.)
That generations-long debate can be seen in the oscillations of U.S. tariff levels throughout history. In 1821, when reliable tariff statistics begin, nearly all imports (95.5%) were taxed, and duties imposed equaled 43.2% of the total value of all imports and 45% of the dutiable value. For the next 100+ years, U.S. trade policy followed a fairly predictable pattern: When Democrats controlled the levers of power, tariff rates were lower; when Whigs or Republicans regained control, rates were higher.
The culmination of this perennial drama – what one contemporary writer called “an endless performance in which the actors are unskilled and the audience dissatisfied; and yet the same old play is staged over and over and over again” – was the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which raised import duties on thousands of agricultural and industrial goods. By 1932, U.S. tariffs equaled 59.1% of the value of dutiable imports, the highest level since 1830. Although duties represented only 19.6% of the value of all imports (since by that time around two-thirds of imported goods were duty-free), that was still the highest level since before World War I. A 1995 survey of economic historians found broad agreement that Smoot-Hawley exacerbated the Great Depression, though to what extent is still debated.","Once highly protective.

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, Algeria was a semi-autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, however an invasion by France in 1830 was the beginning of 130 years of French rule, and the development of Algeria's modern borders by 1875 (although northern Algeria was treated as an extension of the French metropole, with elected representatives in the Assembly). Although the rest of the century saw both medicinal and economic progress, French rule also dismantled traditional Algerian political and societal structures, as well as the oppression of Islam, particularly in rural areas. ","Algeria in the early 1900s The first few decades of the twentieth century saw increasing Algerian and Islamic influence in local government. Throughout both World Wars, Algerian soldiers played an integral part in the French military, and were responsible for Algeria's liberation from Nazi Germany, as well as decisive campaigns in Italy and France. Although Algerian troops often made up the first wave of soldiers to go into battle, they did not receive the same treatment or pay as their French counterparts, and Algerian veterans did not receive the same rights as French veterans until 2017. As Europe's control over its colonies weakened in the mid-1900s, independence movements in countries such as Algeria gained momentum, and the Algerian War of Independence was one of the most violent and arduous during this time. Although it began as guerilla warfare in 1952, a series of massacres and reprisals led to all-out war in 1955, between the National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French-Algerian government. Up to one million Algerian's lost their lives in the war, and approximately twenty percent of the Muslim population became refugees. The war ended in March 1962, through the Evian Accords, and Algeria's independence was acknowledged on July 3, 1962. Independent Algeria In the aftermath of the war, there was a mass exodus of ethnic Europeans, as well as the systematic genocide of thousands of pro-French Algerians who remained in the country. Much of Algeria's agriculture had been destroyed, it's economy was left without structure as the majority of those in positions of power returned to Europe, and seventy percent of the workforce was unemployed. Relative peace followed and the country slowly modernized over the next three decades, however military rule failed to sufficiently stabilize the country, and the government's attempts to suppress Islam's influence in politics eventually led to a civil war in 1992. The civil war involved different factions with Islamic and pro-government agendas, and was very regionalized. The high number of massacres eventually led to splits within all paramilitary factions, which the government then capitalized on to re-establish control, and the war effectively ended in 2002. Since then, the military's control over Algerian politics has gradually decreased, and Algeria has become more peaceful and democratic (however they have not had an elected President since April 2019). Increased stability has also allowed the population to grow exponentially, and today it is almost 44 million people, double what it was in the mid-1980s.

Each have their appeal to fans with different tastes, and the versatility of rock and pop (and music which combines the two) allows such music to reach adults of all ages and backgrounds.

20230304_152148,5,statista1444.png," In the second quarter of 2020, the debt to equity ratio in the United States amounted to 94.66 percent. ","Debt to equity ratio explained The debt to equity financial ratio indicates the relationship between shareholders' equity and debt used to finance the assets of a company. In order to make the calculation the data of the two required components are taken from the firmâ€™s balance sheet. If the company is a publicly traded company then it is possible to make the calculation by taking the market value for both. The composition of debt and equity of an enterprise is much debated as is the influence that it is able to exert on the value of the firm. Nevertheless, it is important in helping investors such as banks to identify companies that are highly leveraged and therefore pose a higher risk. It is best explained by taking the example of an entrepreneur wishing to expand their operation and going to the bank for a loan. If this small business owner had total assets amounting to 120,000 U.S. dollars and liabilities (mostly loans) amounting to 100,000 U.S. dollars the bank to which the request is being made would first have to deduce the business ownerâ€™s equity; 20,000 dollars (total assets minus liabilities). With this figure the bank would proceed to divide total liabilities by equity, which gives the ratio of 500 percent. In other terms, this means that for every one dollar of equity the small business owner has 5 dollars of debt. He is highly leveraged and therefore represents high risk to the bank.

The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of the end of the year. Between the years of 2001 and 2004, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Polish zloty noted a steep increase.

Between 2010 and 2016 the value increased overall, to 4.36 which meant that one euro could buy 4.36 Polish zloty before falling once again in 2019 to 4.3 Polish zloty. This overall increase in an average annual euro to Polish zloty exchange rate is also reflected in the monthly exchange rate in recent years, although in this case the values are measured at one point in time (end of month).

For this specific ranking, the source mentions that it included startups that are less than ten years old. Exceptions were companies which did not mention their founding year, or which were officially listed as a startup despite passing the ten-year mark. ","How many startups are there in Europe? No numbers exist that cover the precise size of the European startup market. This might have to do with the mentioned difficulties surrounding the definition of what a startup exactly is, and that this potentially varies per European country. There are, however, certain indicators which might help. One could look at whether local entrepreneurs were involved in the early phases of a startup (i.e. after generating the first income from sales of products or services).

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn6570.png," How much money does the Dutch government spend on healthcare? In 2021, the government expected to spend a total of 53.4 billion euros through the Zvw or the Health Insurance Act. This law covers the basic health insurance in the Netherlands that all residents and employees in the country are obliged to have. The numbers shown here indicate with which sources the government planned to afford this healthcare. The government expected that most money would go towards secondary care in 2019. ","Health insurance in the Netherlands: two can play that game The health system in the Netherlands has a hybrid character. The Dutch government, on the one hand, decides the contents of the mandatory basis health insurance on a yearly basis. Health insurance companies, on the other hand, have to offer this insurance as a product. They are not allowed to leave anybody out: any Dutch citizen, regardless of age or medical records, must be accepted in this insurance. The Netherlands had 11 health insurance concerns in 2019, which owned roughly 40 companies. Health insurance concern Achmea (formerly Zilveren Kruis) had a market share of approximately 30 percent, whereas the company Achmea Zorgverzekeringen N.V. had the most gross written premiums in this insurance segment. How does the financing work exactly? Dutch citizens have three ways to pay for the statutory health insurance, all three of which are mentioned in this statistic. First, the income related contribution (in Dutch: inkomens afhankelijke bijdrage) is a tax that is paid from oneâ€™s salary. The majority of the healthcare financing shown here was expected to come from this source: approximately 25 billion euros in 2019. Second, the nominal premium (in Dutch: nominale premie) is paid to health insurance companies and is a national average of the basic health insurance premium that the government expects these companies to use when they offer the product. The idea behind this is that free market competition forces companies to go below this average so as to curb increasing health costs (as the companies strive to make healthcare as affordable as possible in order to attract more customers). Third, the mandatory excess (in Dutch: verplichte eigen risico) is a fee the insured (18 years and older, younger ages are exempt from this) must have paid to healthcare during the year before the insurance starts to pay out. This serves the purpose of raising awareness on how expensive healthcare is. ","This statistic shows the results of a survey on the public opinion on the health insurance market in the Netherlands in 2019 , by age group . In the first half of 2019 , roughly 14 percent of the respondents in the country had a health insurance ."

A ranking of the largest electric utilities companies in the United States can be found here as well as a ranking of global electricity prices in select countries. Retail electricity prices in the United States When Thomas A. Edison developed a system to generate and distribute electricity in order to market his greatest creation, the electric light bulb, he would have known little about the dramatic impact his invention would create on civilization 130 years after the inauguration of the worldâ€™s first power station on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York. In 21st century America, electric power is omnipresent in peoplesâ€?lives, as electricity is powering our factories, shops, homes - and even cars. It goes without saying that electricity consumption has to be paid for, and, naturally, people are worried about the size of their electricity bill. On average, retail electricity prices in the United States changed little from 9.90 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011 to 10.60 cents per kilowatt hour in 2019. However, while power rates in the industrial and commercial sectors increased only moderately between 2011 and 2019, residential electricity customers were charged 13.04 cents per kilowatt hour in 2019, up from 11.72 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011. The rising prices are justified by the costs of power production and power grid maintenance. Although the production cost of electricity generated from coal, natural gas and nuclear sources remained relatively flat, the integration of renewable energy sources, investments in smart grid technologies, growing peak demand and power blackouts caused by the vicissitudes of nature continued to trouble the electric utility industry in the recent past. The rates of U.S. electricity prices can also vary widely, with Hawaii residents experiencing some of the highest rates in the country.

Excessive phosphorus and nitrogen can cause eutrophication in aquatic systems. Chlorine, bacteria, viruses, metals, and other substances can also pose risks to aquatic life. Wastewater treatment aims to remove suspended solids before the remaining water, effluent, is released back into the environment. Primary treatment removes about 60 percent of suspended solids from wastewater. In China, the Hebei facility was one of the largest treatment plants in the country as of 2010 , dealing with 40.3 million metric tons of urban wastewater per day. It had previously received funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) but has since been shut down. China is one of the leading exporting nations of water and sewage technology, generating 259.6 million euros in 2011. ","In 2019 , the United States had the largest share of the water treatment market in the United States , with a market share of around 10 percent ."

Real GDP, in a similar vein, is also a very useful indicator; this is a measurement that takes prices changes (inflation and deflation) into account, therefore acting as a key indicator for economic growth.

Singapore had managed to 'flatten the curve' and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus after experiencing a spike in cases between April and July. ","Combating the second wave of Covid-19 Singapore imposed a strict lockdown period between April 7 and June 1, which saw the closure of entertainment venues, food establishments, places of worship, non-essential services, and schools. This seemed to have the intended impact, as the number of daily recorded cases started to decrease after the restrictions were put in place. From June 2, these restrictions were gradually lifted, albeit with strict rules governing mask-wearing, contact tracing, and social distancing, such as limits on the size of private gatherings. Those caught flouting these measures face hefty fines, and subsequent offenders could even face jail time. Bringing the pandemic under control, but at what cost? With the number of cases dropping back to the single digits, Singapore could be cautiously optimistic that they had brought the pandemic back under control. However, the closure of businesses, compounded by the global restrictions on movement, had had an adverse effect on its economy. Singapore would most likely face its worse recession on record, while the resident unemployment rate had already shown an increase in June. However, with the global economy recovering at a faster pace than expected, Singapore might expect a better prognosis for its economy in the coming months.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn158.png,"Presidents have generally become less forgiving over time, at least when looking at the proportion of clemency requests they have granted. Every president from McKinley to Carter granted clemency to at least 20% of those who asked for it, according to the Justice Department data. But the percentages have fallen to the single digits for every president since George H.W. Bush, including Obama, who granted clemency to just 5% of those who petitioned him for it.
Obama’s relatively low percentage, however, is largely due to the fact that his administration encouraged federal prisoners to apply for leniency under a program known as the Clemency Initiative. The program, which launched in April 2014 and ended in 2017 when Obama left office, allowed “qualified federal inmates” – those who met certain Justice Department criteria – to apply to have their prison sentences commuted. The initiative led to a surge in petitions and helps explain why Obama’s use of clemency tilted so heavily toward sentence commutations, rather than pardons.","Clemency petitions soared under  | Obama's Clemency Initiative but have  | fallen since  | Clemency petitions and grants, by fiscal year  | 12K  | 2014-17: Justice Dept.  | Clemency Initiative  | 9K  | 6K  | Received  | 2,938  | 3K  | Granted  | 18  | '80  | 10  | 20  | 90  | '00  | Note: The Clemency Initiative encouraged qualified federal  | inmates to petition to have their sentences commuted.

Since then, the prices saw a sharp rise, peaking at over $140 per barrel in 2008. It dropped to about $70 per barrel in mid 2009."," Main article: Oil shale economics The dominant question for shale oil production is under what conditions shale oil is economically viable.  According to the United States Department of Energy, the capital costs of a 100,000 barrels per day (16,000m3/d) ex-situ processing complex are $310billion.  The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the shale-oil production cost in a given region is lower than the price of petroleum or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent oil shale reclamation), would be in a range of $7095 per barrel ($440600/m3), adjusted to 2005 values.  Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production, the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to $3040 per barrel ($190250/m3) after achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels (16010^6m3). The United States Department of Energy estimates that the ex-situ processing would be economic at sustained average world oil prices above $54 per barrel and in-situ processing would be economic at prices above $35 per barrel.  These estimates assume a return rate of 15%. Royal Dutch Shell announced in 2006 that its Shell ICP technology would realize a profit when crude oil prices are higher than $30per barrel ($190/m3), while some technologies at full-scale production assert profitability at oil prices even lower than $20per barrel ($130/m3).","The statistic shows the global oil production capacity of selected oil gas companies in the United States in 2019 .

Some 14% of workers have found information on social media that has improved their professional opinion of a colleague; at the same time, a similar share (16%) have found information on social media that has lowered their professional opinion of a colleague.","['Workers use social media at work for  | many reasons; taking a mental break is  | one of the most common  | % of workers who sever use social media platforms to  | Take a menta break from work  | 34%  | Connect with friends and  | 27  | familyat work  | Make or support professional  | 24  | connections  | Get information that chelps  | 20  | solve problems at work  | relationships Build or strengthen personal  | 17  | relationships strengthen with coworkers  | Learn about someone  | 17  | they work with  | Ask work-related questions of  | 12  | people outside their organization  | Ask work-related questions of  | 12  | people inside their organization  | Source: Survey conducted Sept. 11-21 2014  | ""Social Media and the Workplace  | PEW RESEARCH CENTER ']","This statistic shows the results of a survey conducted in the United States on whether they use social media to use their personal care .

Among the 41% of U.S. adults who have experienced one or more of the six behaviors that this survey uses to define online harassment, 36% feel their most recent experience does indeed qualify as “online harassment.” At the same time, 37% say they do not think of their experience as online harassment, and another 27% are unsure if they were victims of online harassment or not. Strikingly, 28% of those whose most recent encounter involved severe types of abusive behavior – such as stalking, sexual harassment, sustained harassment or physical threats – do not think of their own experience as constituting “online harassment.” Meanwhile, 32% of those who have only encountered “mild” behaviors such as name-calling or embarrassment do consider their most recent experience to be online harassment.
Beyond their own personal experiences, a substantial majority of Americans (66%) say they have witnessed some type of harassing behavior directed toward others online, with 39% indicating they have seen others targeted with severe behaviors such as stalking, physical threats, sustained harassment or sexual harassment.

Fully 86% of 18- to 29-year-olds say they have witnessed at least one of these six behaviors, and 62% have seen others targeted for severe forms of abuse.
Exposure to these behaviors can have pronounced impacts on those witnessing them. In some cases, this involves people taking basic precautions to protect themselves: 28% of Americans say that observing the harassment of others has influenced them to set up or adjust their own privacy settings. But in other cases, widespread abusive behavior can have a more pronounced chilling effect: 27% of U.S. adults say they have refrained from posting something online after witnessing the harassment of others, and 13% of the population has elected to stop using an online service due to the harassment of others they observe.

A value of 0 represents absolute equality, whereas 100 would be the highest possible degree of inequality. This measurement reflects the degree of wealth inequality at a certain moment in time, though it may fail to capture how average levels of income improve or worsen over time.What affects the Gini coefficient in Latin America? Latin America, as other developing regions in the world, generally records high rates of inequality, with a Gini coefficient ranging between 38 and 54 points according to the latest available data from the reporting period 2010-2017. According to the Human Development Report 2019, wealth redistribution by means of tax transfers improves Latin America's Gini coefficient to a lesser degree than it does in advanced economies.

By 1840, turnout among the white, male electorate topped 80%; the total number of votes cast that year was 60% higher than in 1836.

As the H1N1 influenza virus, known as the Spanish Flu, spread across the world and infected between one third and a quarter of the global population, it impacted all areas of society. One such impact was on workers' wages, as the labor shortage drove up the demand for skilled workers, which then increased wages. In the United States, wages had already increased due to the shortage of workers caused by the war, however the trend increased further in the two or three years after the war, despite the return of so many personnel from overseas.  In the first fifteen years of the twentieth century, wages across the shown industries had increased gradually and steadily in line with inflation, with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from roughly 15 cents per hour to 21 cents per hour in this period. Between 1915 and 1921 or 1921 however, the hourly rate more than doubled across most of these industries, with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from 21 cents per hour in 1915 to 56 cents per hour in 1920. Although manufacturing wages were the lowest among those shown here, the trend was similar across even the highest paying trades, with hourly wages in the building trade increasing from 57 cents per hour in 1915 to one dollar and eight cents in 1921. The averages of almost all these trades decreased again in 1922, before plateauing or increasing at a slower rate throughout the late 1920s. Other factors, such as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression, make comparing this data with wages in later decades more difficult, but it does give some insight into the economic effects of pandemics in history.

The 28-year-old eight-time All-Star took home an annual salary of 37.67 million U.S. dollars in the 2020 season. ","MLB salaries The MLB has both a minimum player salary and a competitive balance tax (also called Luxury Tax) in place to ensure the league remains competitive and that no single team can buy its way to victory. In 2019, the minimum player salary stood at 555 thousand U.S. dollars, a generous increase from the minimum salary of 400 thousand U.S. dollars ten years earlier. However, because of the astronomical earnings of some of the star players in the league, the average player salary across the MLB was 4.36 million U.S. dollars in 2019. If a teamâ€™s payroll exceeds a certain figure, they are forced to pay a luxury tax in order to discourage the largest teams from buying the best players in the league. In 2019, this payroll cap was 206 million U.S. dollars and it will be increased slightly in the coming years.

Viewership climbed 6% in the morning (5 to 7 a.m.) and 3% in the early evening (5 to 7 p.m.) newscasts, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis. The audience barely edged up—by .1%—in the late night slot (11 p.m.), a newscast that had suffered the biggest decreases in recent years.
The good news comes after a difficult 2012 when late night and early evening audiences each dropped by 7% and the morning audience decreased by 5%. Indeed, viewership for all three slots had declined every year from 2008-2012—with the exception of a small uptick in 2011. Pew Research analyzes Nielsen Media Research audience data for all four major sweeps periods — February, May, July and November — and computes national averages for each time slot.
The jump in viewership in the key timeslots was due largely to significant increases in the November sweeps period when morning news was up 12%, early evening grew by 8% and late night increased by 6%. While it is impossible to know whether the 2013 numbers are a harbinger of a new spurt of audience growth, they coincide with a wave of consolidation that has seen bullish media companies—from Gannett to Tribune—buy up large groups of stations.

Even including 2013, the morning newscasts—the most consistent viewership performer in local news—has lost 3% of its audience since 2007.

In 2012 for the first time, more Latinos said they favored same-sex marriage than opposed it (52% versus 34%) according to a Pew Hispanic Center survey. This is a reversal from six years earlier, when one-third (31%) of Latinos favored same-sex marriage and more than half (56%) opposed it. This shift in views tracks with that of the general public, whose opinions on same-sex marriage have also changed in recent years.
But even though more Hispanics now favor same-sex marriage than oppose it, not all Hispanic groups hold the same view.

By contrast, the strongest opposition to same-sex marriage comes from Evangelical Hispanics, 66% of whom oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.

California, was the leading producer, where 40.4 billion pounds of milk were produced in 2018. ","Milk production Dairy farming is an agricultural business which is engaged in the long-term milk production within the dairy industry. It is a large contributor to the overall economy in many states. California, Wisconsin, New York, Idaho and Pennsylvania had the highest milk supply in 2016. The Badger State Wisconsin is also known as â€˜Americas Dairylandâ€? The slogan is even engraved on its license plate. The number of U.S. dairy farms has sharply decreased in the last decades, while dairy operations have ever-larger numbers of cows concentrated on a single farm. These extensive dairy farming conditions with a large herd size and a high milk output are seen as a profitable way for the milk industry in order to provide milk at relatively low cost for the consumer. Due to its high milk volume, the main cow used for milk production is the Holstein-Friesian. However, with this intensification of milking cows there comes a corresponding concentration of manure production which causes problems and challenges for the environment such as the risk of elevated nitrogen levels or contaminated ground water. Due to these environmental impacts, many dairy operations in Wisconsin are now facing opposition regarding plans to expand their dairy herds.

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn3539.png,"U.S. births outside of marriage have declined since 2008, primarily among immigrant women. Over the long term, nonmarital births had been on the rise in the U.S. In 2014, 40% of all U.S. births were to unmarried women, up from 21% of births in 1984. Among foreign-born women, the share of births that occurred outside of marriage hit a high of 37% in 2008 and has since fallen steadily. Among U.S.-born women, the share of babies born outside of marriage has held steady over that same period. While foreign-born women have always been less likely to have babies outside of marriage than U.S.-born women, the roughly 10-percentage-point gap in this measure in 2014 (42% vs. 33%) is the widest since data became available in 1984.
The decline in unmarried births to foreign-born moms is due in part to their changing regional origins. In recent years, the share of babies born to moms from Latin America has declined, while the share of babies born to moms from regions such as Asia has increased. New foreign-born mothers from Latin America were roughly four times as likely as moms from Asia to be unmarried in 2014. This shift reflects a larger change in U.S. immigration: Asia recently replaced Latin America as the largest source of new immigrants to the U.S.","Births outside of marriage most  | common among moms from Latin  | America  | % of USS births to mothers who are unmarried, by  | mother's nativity and region of birth, 2014  | Latin Ame rica  | 48  | U.S born  | 42  | Ocea nia  | 38  | All foreign born  | 33  | Sub Saha ran Africa  | 26  | Europe  | 17  | Other North Ame rica  | 11  | Asia  | 10  | Middle East-North Africa  | 5  | Source: Pew Research Centeranalysis ofNational Center forHealth  | Statistics data  | ""Births outside ofmarriage decline for immigrantwwmmen""  | PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","This statistic shows the number of births of mothers in Mexico in 2014 , by region of origin and Hispanic origin .

20230304_152148,5,statista19242.png," By January 20, 2021, 45 men will have served as the President of the United States (officially 46, as Grover Cleveland served twice as the 22nd and 24th president). Of these 45 men, 31 have had a military background, with ranks ranging from a militia private to five star generals. There is some correlation between the ages of the presidents and major wars in U.S. history; explaining why none of those in office between 1909 and 1945 had any military background, and why six of the ten veteran presidents since then served in the National Guard or Naval Reserve. Three US presidents have held the highest position in the U.S. military, they were; George Washington, Commander in Chief of the Continental Army during the War of Independence, Ulysses S. Grant, Commanding General of the US Army during the American Civil War, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe in the Second World War. ","Popular professions In terms of non-military roles, the most common profession for U.S. presidents before taking office was that of a lawyer. 27 U.S. presidents studied and practiced law before entering the world of politics, while Harry S. Truman met all the criteria to become a lawyer, before political and personal circumstances prevented this (although he was posthumously awarded an honorary law license in 1996). Joe Biden will be the most recent U.S. president to have held this job, however the profession was much more common in earlier years, as 22 of the first 32 presidents had been lawyers. Eight presidents had also worked in the education sector, with four schoolteachers, three college professors and one university dean being elected to office; and a number went on to teach or serve on university boards after their time in office. More uncommon jobs for U.S. presidents include Hollywood actor (Ronald Reagan), inventor (Thomas Jefferson), peanut farmer (Jimmy Carter) and reality TV host (Donald Trump). Donald Trump is the only US President without any military or political background. Political roles Including President-elect Joe Biden, a total of 15 vice presidents have ascended to the presidency; eight were due to the death of their respective president, six were elected for their first term, and Gerald R. Ford assumed the presidency following the resignation of Richard Nixon. Of the nine men who assumed the presidency following a death or resignation, five were re-elected to serve a full term. Thomas Jefferson and Richard Nixon are the only vice presidents to have won two presidential elections, and Jefferson is the only one to have completed both full terms. The most common political background of a U.S. president is that of a Congressman in the House of Representatives, with 18 presidents having served in this role, while 17 also served in the U.S. Congress as Senators. Additionally, 17 U.S. presidents had served as state governors, and William Howard Taft was the Governor-General of the Philippines from 1901 to 1903, when it was a U.S. territory.

When she clicked the button, it flled her triangle with the default color (orange) without announcing the change, and switched focus from the menu back to her triangle (see Figure 12b). P2 was confused and navigated back to the Shape Fill button and clicked it again, and it switched focus back to her triangle once more, prompting her to voice confusion and frustration: “What?

Simultaneously, the cost of natural gas dramatically decreased, making it a stronger competitor with coal and petroleum.

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn6262.png," The pole vault has been included as a men's event in all Olympics since the Athens Games in1896, while the women's event did not feature until 104 years later at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Historically, the United States has been the most successful nation in the pole vault at the Olympics, winning all gold medals between 1896 and 1968 (including two golds for a joint victory in 1908), and currently has 21 golds across the men's and women's events. The current Olympic record for men was set by Brazil's Thiago Braz da Silva in 2016, with a jump of 6.03 meters; and the women's Olympic record was set by Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva in 2008, with a jump of 5.05 meters. Isinbayeva also set the world record for women with a jump of 5.06 meters in 2009, while the men's world record of 6.18 meters was set by Armand Duplantis of Sweden in February 2020. Isinbaya holds another record in the event, as the only woman to have won two Olympic gold medals, in 2004 and 2008; the US' Bob Richards is the only man to have won two golds, in 1952 and 1956. ","Rules and regulations Although there is much more equipment used for the pole vault than for most other track and field events, the apparatus has arguably fewer restrictions placed upon it than any other event (such as the javelin throw). Athletes can use poles of any length or diameter, and made from any combination of materials. The pole's surface must be smooth, but athletes can use as much tape to the grip and ends of the pole as they like. For the run-up, the runway is at least forty meters in length, and athletes can place two markers on the runway to help them time their jump. After completing the run-up, competitors plant their pole in a meter long box that's sixty centimeters wide at the front, fifteen centimeters wide at the back, and twenty centimeters deep at the back wall. The wall is used by the jumpers as the pivot point before they begin their ascent. In the air Once the jumper's feet leave the ground, there are strict rules about the position of the hands on the pole; the lower hand may be moved upwards, but neither hand can move higher than the upper hand's position upon take off. The crossbar is 4.5 meters in length, and vaulters are allowed to decide what height the crossbar is to be set at before they make each attempt. After three consecutive missed vaults, the competitor is eliminated from the competition. If two or more competitors jump at the same height then the number of missed vaults is used to determine the winner; if the number of faults is the same for each competitor then a jump-off is used to decide the winner (although this is rare). Because of the techniques used in the pole vault, many competitors have backgrounds in gymnastics rather than track and field (although higher speed and power do give a large advantage at the top level).

20230304_152148,5,pewmultiColumn1596.png,"People who are dissatisfied with democracy in their country are less likely to feel that economic conditions in their country are good, that the financial situation of average people has improved over the past 20 years, and that key democratic norms are being respected, the study finds. Notably, however, dissatisfaction with democracy has little relationship to external assessments of how wealthy or democratic a given country actually is, based on measures from the World Bank, Freedom House, the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Electoral Integrity Project.
Dissatisfaction with democracy is not related to the overall wealth of a country, but it is strongly related to pessimistic views of the current economic situation. This is the case whether wealth is measured as gross domestic product or as GDP per capita. For example, 9% of Brazilians think their economic situation is good, and 83% are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their country. Swedes, on the other hand, have a much rosier outlook on both their economy and democracy: 81% think their country’s economic situation is good, and only about a third (30%) say they are dissatisfied with democracy.
People’s assessments of how the average person’s financial situation has changed over the past 20 years are related to dissatisfaction with democracy. In most of the countries surveyed, minorities believe that the average person’s financial situation has improved compared with 20 years ago. This pessimism is strongly related to how people feel about democratic performance. For instance, in Greece, where 7% say the financial situation of average people has gotten better, 84% say they are dissatisfied with how democracy is operating in their country. In contrast, in India, 65% believe the financial situation has improved and just a third are dissatisfied with democracy.",Economic pessimism is linked to dissatisfaction with how democracy is working  | % who say they are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their country  | 100 %  | North America  | Europe  | Russia  | Greece  | Mexico  | Brazil  | Asia-Pacific  | Spain  | 80  | Middle East  | Sub-Saharan Africa  | Italy  | Tunisia  | Latin America  | South Africa  | Argentina  | Nigeria  | 60  | Japan  | U.S.  | UK  | Hungary  | France  | Russia  | Poland  | Kenya  | Germany  | Israel  | Australia  | 40  | Canada  | South Korea  | Netherlands  | Indonesia  | India  | Philippines Sweden  | 20  | Correlation INTERTARIZED -0.81  | 20  | 40  | 80  | 100 %  | 60  | % who say the current economic situation is good  | Source: Spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey.

Lee's forces, during Grant's Overland Campaign in May and June 1864 during the American Civil War. This campaign took place over eight weeks in Virginia, as Grant's union troops pushed the Confederate forces further back through Virginia, culminating in the Sieges of Richmond and Petersburg. Although the Union sustained heavier casualties than the Confederacy, they emerged victorious from the campaign, as they had inflicted a higher proportion of casualties to the South. It was during this point of the war where the Union's superior numbers proved instrumental in determining the outcome of the war. ","The Wilderness The Battle of the Wilderness is so named as it reflects the conditions in which the battle was fought, as it took places in the dense forests of Virginia, near Spotsylvania, between May 5 and 7, 1864. The fighting took place in sporadic encounters and skirmishes, with different corps from each army intercepting one another as they navigated their way through the forest. The outcome of the battle is deemed inconclusive, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, while achieving some of their primary goals. Grant was waging a war of attrition (where the aim is to defeat one's enemy by wearing down their numbers and resources) against Lee, and was successful in taking out a large portion of his forces while slowing his retreat. In contrast, Lee's goal was to outmanoeuvre the bulk of his army to a more favorable position in order to regroup and hold out for reinforcements, with which he had some success. Aftermath The location of the battle was a major influence in the outcome, as the density of the trees and the limited lighting caused confusion among the troops and allowed more organized regiments to ambush their enemies. In total, an estimated 163 thousand men took place in the battle, with approximately thirty thousand becoming casualties. Although the Union sustained roughly seven thousand more casualties than the Confederacy, as mentioned above, their strength in numbers and their ability to replace lost soldiers was the key to their overall success. This battle was immediately followed by the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, which lasted from May 8 to 21, 1864.

The company had not had widespread success for some time, but the iPod paved the way for other innovative and extremely successful products, such as the iPhone, launched in 2007, and the iPad, released in 2010. The first version of the iPod had a 5 GB hard drive, which could be used for storing music, but could also serve as an external data storage device. iPod sales were slow at first, due to the deviceâ€™s need for a Macintosh computer and its iTunes software. However, the company continued to update the product, adding newer versions, such as the iPod Shuffle, iPod Nano and iPod Touch, with improved design, features and hard drive capacity.

China and India held second and third place respectively with regard to Australiaâ€™s foreign-born population. The relative dominance of Asian countries in the list of top ten foreign-born residents of Australia represents a significant shift in Australiaâ€™s immigration patterns over the past few decades. Where European-born migrants had previously overshadowed other migrant groups, Australian migration figures are now showing greater migration numbers from neighboring countries in Asia and the Pacific. ","A history of migration Australia is often referred to as an â€˜immigrant nationâ€? alongside the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. Before the Second World War, migrants to Australia were almost exclusively from the UK, however after 1945, Australiaâ€™s immigration policy was broadened to attract economic migrants and temporary skilled migrants. These policy changes saw and increase in immigrants particularly from Greece and Italy. Today, Australia maintains its status as an â€˜â€™Immigrant nationâ€™â€? with almost 30 percent of the population born overseas and around 50 percent of the population having at least one parent that was born overseas. Australian visas The Australian immigration program has two main categories of visa, permanent and temporary. The permanent visa category offers three primary pathways: skilled, family and humanitarian. The skilled visa category is by far the most common, with more than a million permanent migrants living in Australia on this visa category at the last Australian census in 2016. Of the temporary visa categories, the higher education visa is the most popular, outnumbering even the temporary visitor category by more than 10,000 visitors. ","The statistic shows the share of immigrants living in Australia in the United States from 2002 to 2019 . In 2019 , about 2.32 million people lived in the United Kingdom ."

20230304_152148,5,statista23191.png," Humans have been living on the continent of Australia (name derived from ""Terra Australis""; Latin for ""the southern land"") for approximately 65,000 years, however population growth was relatively slow until the nineteenth century. Europeans had made some contact with Australia as early as 1606, however there was no significant attempt at settlement until the late eighteenth century. By 1800, the population of Australia was approximately 350,000 people, and the majority of these were Indigenous Australians. As colonization progressed the number of ethnic Europeans increased while the Australian Aboriginal population was decimated through conflict, smallpox and other diseases, with some communities being exterminated completely, such as Aboriginal Tasmanians. ","Mass migration from Britain and China After the loss of its American colonies in the 1780s, the British Empire looked to other parts of the globe to expand its sphere of influence. In Australia, the first colonies were established in Sydney, Tasmania and Western Australia. Many of these were penal colonies which became home to approximately 164,000 British and Irish convicts who were transported to Australia between 1788 and 1868. As the decades progressed, expansion into the interior intensified, and the entire country was claimed by Britain in 1826. Inland colonization led to further conflict between European settlers and indigenous Australians, which cost the lives of thousands of natives. Inward expansion also saw the discovery of many natural resources, and most notably led to the gold rushes of the 1850s, which attracted substantial numbers of Chinese migrants to Australia. This mass migration from non-European countries eventually led to some restrictive policies being introduced, culminating with the White Australia Policy of 1901, which cemented ethnic-European dominance in Australian politics and society. These policies were not retracted until the second half of the 1900s. Independent Australia Australia changed its status to a British dominion in 1901, and eventually became independent in 1931. Despite this, Australia has remained a part of the British Commonwealth, and Australian forces (ANZAC) fought with the British and their Allies in both World Wars, and were instrumental in campaigns such as Gallipoli in WWI, and the South West Pacific Theater in WWII. The aftermath of both wars had a significant impact on the Australian population, with approximately 90 thousand deaths in both world wars combined, as well as 15 thousand deaths as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic following WWI, although Australia experienced a significant baby boom following the Second World War. In the past fifty years, Australia has promoted immigration from all over the world, and now has one of the strongest economies and highest living standards in the world, with a population that has grown to over 25 million people in 2020.

This includes used rails for re-rolling and other uses as well as ships, boats, and other vessels for scrapping. The majority of scrap consumption in the domestic industry can be attributed to manufacturers of pig iron, raw steel, and steel castings. The manufacturers use scrap in combination with pig iron and direct-reduced iron to produce steel products for a wide range of applications, including appliances, construction, machinery, and oil and gas. Other uses for iron and steel scrap include producing cast iron and steel products by the ferrous castings industry as well as for the production of ferroalloys, and the precipitation of copper by the chemical industry. In comparison, exports of steel scrap from Mexico totaled only 626,000 metric tons in 2017.

During the survey, 91 percent of respondents stated that they think using birth control is morally acceptable, while 6 percent considered it morally wrong to use contraceptives. ","Moral acceptance of contraception Morality is the attempt at defining what is right or wrong about our actions and thoughts. Contraception is one of the more controversial issues and is a frequent topic of heated discussions. In the United States, contraception is widely morally acceptable nowadays, as 89 percent of Americans share this belief, while only 8 percent believe that contraception is morally wrong. This is not surprising, as another survey indicates that between 97 and 100 percent of sexually experienced American women over 15 years used contraception between 2006 and 2010. However, a slightly lower percentage of Catholics support the use of contraceptives. In the United States, there have been a number of lawsuits that oppose the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on the basis of religious grounds and religious freedom, because the Act requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover and include access to contraception. Further, fifty-five percent of American Catholics believe that religiously-affiliated employers, who desire to be exempt from having to cover contraception in their health plans, should be able to do so. Despite these lawsuits, it is still clear that the majority of people in the U.S. both morally accept and use contraceptives. However, this is not the case across the world; in Pakistan only 12 percent believe that contraceptive use is morally acceptable while 65 percent believe that it is morally wrong.

It was not unheard of prior to this that music fans would pool together money in order to support bands and musicians on their tours. After the initial pioneering stage of ArtistShare other platforms began to appear and the crowdfunding sector started to show strong signs of growth, in the United States initially and then in Europe.

In the age of austerity and financial uncertainty, some see the role of such funding organizations as positive. Many banks in a number of countries are reluctant to make capital loans to small businesses, sparking accusations among some that lenders are failing to lend their support to a key potential area of economic growth.

A new analysis of about 300,000 tweets in Greek and English, collected between July 6 and 12, finds that the conversation about the controversial leader has been primarily negative in tone, especially among those posting tweets in Greek.

The Twitter activity in English was considerably larger in volume than that in Greek, and it contained a larger share of neutral discussion, but the same general pattern held.

The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry, raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the countryâ€™s heavy reliance on revenues coming from London's financial sector, arguably the most important in the world and one of the globeâ€™s financial command centers. Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism, the United Kingdom has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service. The Big Bang policy, one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform, involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets. This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work, and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks. This, one could argue, strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute, the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK.

Market value and market capitalization are two terms frequently used â€?and confused - when discussing the profitability and viability of companies. Strictly speaking, market capitalization (or market cap) is the worth of a company based on the total value of all their shares; an important metric when determining the comparative value of companies for trading opportunities. Accordingly, many stock exchanges such as the New York or London Stock Exchange release market capitalization data on their listed companies. On the other hand, market value technically refers to what a company is worth in a much broader context. It is determined by multiple factors, including profitability, corporate debt, and the market environment as a whole. In this sense it aims to estimate the overall value of a company, with share price only being one element. Market value is therefore useful for determining whether a companyâ€™s shares are over- or undervalued, and in arriving at a price if the company is to be sold. Such valuations are generally made on a case-by-case basis though, and not regularly reported. For this reason, market capitalization is often reported as market value. What are the top companies in the world? The answer to this question depends on the metric used. Although one of the largest companies by market capitalization, Appleâ€™s global revenue did not manage to crack the top ten of companies. Rather, American multinational retailer Walmart was ranked number of the worldâ€™s largest companies in the world by revenue. Walmart also had the highest number of employees in the world.

20230304_152148,5,statista1036.png," Iranâ€™s inflation rate rose sharply to 41.02 percent in 2019 and was projected to rise another six percentage points before slowly starting to decline. Given the recent sanctions by the United States regarding the nuclear deal, this number has both political and economic implications. ","Political implications President Hassan Rouhani won the 2017 election based on economic promises, many stemming from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Lifting these sanctions opened the Iranian economy to many opportunities, including the chance to benefit from increased oil exports. The JCPOA was an integral part of the Rouhani campaign, so any economic hardship that is linked to the deal will likely be blamed on the president. Economic implications High inflation leads to high interest rates, which leads to less borrowing. Less borrowing means less investment, which slows economic growth. This slower growth often leads to higher inflation, which is what economists call an inflationary spiral. As such, Iran will have difficulty achieving substantial GDP growth until inflation returns to manageable rates.

In the results using the experimental technique, self-reports of non-heterosexual identity amounted to 19% of those surveyed using the Veiled Report methods – 65% higher than the 11% in the control group. The share reporting same-sex sexual experiences also grew from 17% in the control group to 27% in the Veiled Report group, they reported. (Because their experiment did not use a random sample of the adult population, the researchers do not attempt to estimate the actual size of the country’s gay and lesbian population.)
The experimental method also increased the rates of anti-gay sentiment. For example, the share who disapproved of having an openly gay manager at work increased from 16% in the control group to 27% in the Veiled Report group. The proportion who thought it should be legal to discriminate when hiring on the basis of sexual orientation also rose from 14% to 25%.
However, those in the Veiled Report treatment were less likely than those in the Direct Report treatment to say that a homosexual person “can change their sexual orientation if they choose to do so” (22% vs. 15%).

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn1500.png," The influenza pandemic of 1918, known as the Spanish Flu, was one of the deadliest and widespread pandemics in human history. The scale of the outbreak, as well as limitations in technology, medicine and communication, create difficulties when trying to uncover accurate figures relating to the pandemic. Estimates suggest that the virus, known as the H1N1 influenza virus, infected more than one quarter of the global population, which equated to approximately 500 million people in 1920. It was responsible for roughly 25 million fatalities, although some projections suggest that it could have caused double this number of deaths. The exact origins of this strain of influenza remain unclear to this day, however it was first noticed in Western Europe in the latter stages of the First World War. Wartime censorship in Europe meant that the severity of the pandemic was under-reported, while news outlets in neutral Spain were free to report openly about the impact of the virus; this gave the illusion that the virus was particularly strong in Spain, giving way to the term ""Spanish Flu"". ","Effects of the virus By late summer 1918, the pandemic had spread across the entire continent, and the H1N1 virus had mutated into a deadlier strain that weakened the infected's immune system more than traditional influenzas. Some studies suggest that, in contrast to these traditional influenza viruses, having a stronger immune system was actually a liability in the case of the H1N1 virus as it triggered what is known as a ""cytokine storm"". This is where white blood cells release proteins called cytokines, which signal the body to attack the virus, in turn releasing more white blood cells which release more cytokines. This cycle over-works and greatly weakens the immune system, often giving way to other infections; most commonly pneumonia in the case of the Spanish Flu. For this reason, the Spanish Flu had an uncommonly high fatality rate among young adults, who are traditionally the healthiest group in society. Some theories for the disproportionate death-rate among young adults suggest that the elderly's immune systems benefitted from exposure to earlier influenza pandemics, such as the ""Asiatic/Russian Flu"" pandemic of 1889. Decrease in life expectancy As the war in Europe came to an end, soldiers returning home brought the disease to all corners of the world, and the pandemic reached global proportions. Isolated and under-developed nations were especially vulnerable; particularly in Samoa, where almost one quarter of the population died within two months and life expectancy fell to just barely over one year for those born in 1918; this was due to the arrival of a passenger ship from New Zealand in November 1918, where the infected passengers were not quarantined on board, allowing the disease to spread rapidly. Other areas where life expectancy dropped below ten years for those born in 1918 were present-day Afghanistan, the Congo, Fiji, Guatemala, Kenya, Micronesia, Serbia, Tonga and Uganda. The British Raj, now Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, saw more fatalities than any other region, with as many as five percent of the entire population perishing as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic also had a high fatality rate among pregnant women and infants, and greatly impacted infant mortality rates across the world. There were several waves of the pandemic until late 1920, although they decreased in severity as time progressed, and none were as fatal as the outbreak in 1918. A new strain of the H1N1 influenza virus did re-emerge in 2009, and was colloquially known as ""Swine Flu""; thankfully it had a much lower fatality rate due to medical advancements across the twentieth century.

The overall number of staff working in local TV newsrooms declined slightly in 2013, and salaries for on-air anchors and reporters stagnated. At the same time, news budgets were generally higher last year, and more stations than ever are now airing regular newscasts.
Salaries for on-air staffers were flat. The median salary for a news anchor dropped from $64,000 in 2012 to 62,500 last year. Meteorologists’ salaries were almost the same, at $55,500, in 2013 and $55,000 in 2012. But they are down from $60,000 in 2011. Sports anchors earned the same pay — $45,000 — in each of the past three years. News reporters saw a slight uptick — from $30,000 in 2012 to $31,000 in 2013 — but they earned $32,000 in 2011. The staffers who saw the largest increase in pay (10%) in 2013 were the stations’ graphic specialists, highlighting the growing value of those skilled at producing better storytelling TV visuals.",News Staff Salaries Stagnant in 2013  | Median salaries in thousands  | 2013 2012  | 85  | News Director  | 85  | 65  | Ass.

In 2019, approximately 24 billion square feet of wallboard products were sold in the United States. ","Building materials in the United States: wallboard After its tremendous downturn following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the housing industry in the United States is making a comeback, especially in markets like New York, Dallas and Houston. S&P/Case Shiller's national home price index for the United States was expected to grow to some 205 points in 2018, up from around 128 points in 2011, the worst year for US housing in half a decade. As a result, building material manufacturers are trying to tap into the market and have begun to raise prices dramatically. Thus, homebuilders are faced with increasing costs of building materials. Major companies involved in building materials include the United States Gypsum Corporation, Lafarge and Wacker. Wallboard, which is also known as drywall, plasterboard or gypsum board, is a panel made of gypsum plaster. The panel is usually sandwiched between two thick sheets of paper to make interior wall and ceilings. Wallboard construction is prevalent in North America in comparison to the traditional usage of lath and plaster due to quicker application. Some 42 million metric tons of gypsum was consumed in the U.S. in 2019. The rise in prices is believed to be driven by increased building activity and demand from home improvement retailers. In the long run, expensive construction materials are set to have an impact on property prices, too. At 326,400 US dollars, the U.S. median house price of new homes sold in the US has increased steadily over the last decades.

20230304_152148,5,statista22553.png," Edward Jenner's work on smallpox, published in 1797, was the first time that any scientific findings about vaccination were presented to the wider medical community. Within a few short years of this publication, vaccination had been practiced in most European countries, and the impact was beginning to show almost immediately; particularly in countries such as Sweden and England. As vaccination practices spread, the severity and frequency of smallpox pandemics declined, and the disease ceased to be endemic in some regions. ","Iceland leads the way Epidemics had played a significant role in Iceland's history and development throughout the pre-vaccination era. The country's geographical location meant that viruses did not spread from other countries as frequently as they did on Europe's mainland, however, this also meant that generations would reach adulthood without developing any immunity to these diseases. When these factors were coupled with Iceland's highly concentrated population, this enabled epidemics to spread rapidly throughout the population with devastating effect. The most famous of these epidemics was between 1707 and 1709, where a ship from mainland Europe brought smallpox to Iceland, and the resulting outbreak killed over one third of the entire population. For these reasons, Iceland (although a dominion of Denmark at the time) became the first country in the world to introduce mandatory vaccination, in 1802. The Great Smallpox Pandemic of the 1870s was the last outbreak of the disease to reach pandemic level across Europe. Unbeknownst at the time, this would mark the last ever recorded case of naturally occurring smallpox in Iceland, in 1872. This made Iceland the first country in the world to eradicate the disease on a national level; the same factors that had allowed smallpox to be so devastating to Iceland's population in the past (i.e. distance from mainland Europe and a highly concentrated population) had become the reason why vaccination was so effective in the nineteenth century. The progress of elimination After Iceland's success, it would be another 23 years before the final smallpox cases would be recorded in any other European countries, with Sweden and Norway being the only other countries to eliminate the disease in the nineteenth century. In 1904, French Guiana was the first non-European territory to eradicate the virus, and Oceania* became the first continent to do so; with the last recorded cases in New Zealand and Australia taking place in 1914 and 1917 respectively. The United States recorded its final naturally occurring case of smallpox in 1948, and the final European case was in Portugal in 1953. Smallpox proved more difficult to eradicate in less-developed continents, due to a variety of barriers; such as dense populations and limits in infrastructure (the lack of roads made it especially difficult to combat the disease in Sub-Saharan Africa). The World Health Organization launched the Smallpox Eradication Programme in 1966, and after a number of aggressive vaccination and containment campaigns, the final case of naturally occurring smallpox was recorded in Somalia in 1977. For the next two years, scientists continued to monitor the global situation, but could find no further cases or outbreaks of the disease. On May 08. 1980, the World Health Assembly declared that smallpox had been eradicated, making it the first (and only, as of 2020) human disease to have been eradicated. This was one of the most significant and important medical developments in human history, and it has paved the way for the eradication of other communicable diseases, such as polio and measles; which are expected to be wiped out in the coming decades.

","Employment and economy in the United States The most notable surge in unemployment in the United States occurred between 2008 and 2009, and peaked in 2010. The United States was one of the countries most severely affected by the global financial crisis, primarily due to the crash originally materializing in the country. The crisis had a considerable effect on American households, most prominently on the labor market, which was also met with a significant decline in the stock market as well as the housing market. In order to stabilize and maintain a healthy economy, the United States government was inclined to absorb debt. The countryâ€™s national debt had increased yearly, however surged most remarkably in 2009 and has almost doubled in roughly 6 years since the crash. In order to determine if a country is able to pay back debt, the so-called debt-to-GDP ratio is used. It is often expressed as a percentage - the lower the percentage, the more likely a country can pay back debts without absorbing further debt. The United Statesâ€?debt-to-GDP ratio correspondingly began increasing in 2008, after experiencing an annual decline in the years prior, and is continuing to increase. Additionally, the United States maintained a budget deficit over the past decade, implying that its expenditures are higher than its revenues.

This number has been slowly increasing for the past ten years. Higher population density is associated with urbanization, but not necessarily economic growth. ","Comparative densities Franceâ€™s population density is higher than the European average. In fact, it is higher than any region except Asia, as well as the total world population density. This is likely due to the number of large cities in France. The country has one of the largest urban populations in the world. This shapes the French economic and social landscapes; the cities become more expensive, but they also bring more economic opportunities. These opportunites attract people both from the French countryside and other countries who hope to benefit from such jobs. A tale of two countries For those who can afford it, Paris can be a cosmopolitan paradise. However, with the average price of a rental apartment twice that of most other French cities, few can afford to live in the richest parts of the city. This stark difference in costs implies that average annual wages should have a similar difference between cities. While this is not a perfectly even cause and effect, it gives some explanation for the increasing population density of France.

20230304_152148,5,statista893.png," In 2018, there were approximately 1.2 million insurance agents, brokers and service employees in the United States. ","The insurance industry and employment The number of the U.S. insurance brokers, agents and service employees has remained relatively stable during the difficult period that followed the recession of 2008 and the period of financial insecurity that ensued, and, to some extent, remains to this day. This is consistent with the general acceptance of the fact that the insurance industry is fairly recession-proof. Insurance companies tend to be conservative in a fiscal sense, and regardless of what the economy is doing, people need insurance. A further benefit which allows insurance companies a relatively high level of independence is the fact that they are generally mutual insurance companies, which answer to policy holders rather than to Wall Street. This is not to say, however, that the industry is immune to the effects of the economic situation around it. If gas prices rise, for example, consumers may decide not to buy the second car they had been thinking about, or the house extension they had been planning. This, in turn, means fewer policies sold by the insurance companies. At the same time, crime levels generally tend to rise in a period of recession, meaning higher claims made and higher payouts made by the insurance company. The economic situation and the insurance industry are reliant on one another and both require each other in one way or another for prosperity and stability. People may not think of the insurance industry as the most glamorous opportunity for employment, but employment levels have been steadily rising in the industry. ","This statistic shows the number of employees in the U.S. and home industry industry between the fiscal year of 2008 and the fiscal year of 2019 .

","Population development in China As of mid 2018, China was the country with the largest population worldwide, closely followed by India, which ranked second with a population of about 1.37 billion people. As population growth in India is higher than in China, India will soon become the most populous country in the world. Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people, population growth has subsided over the past decades, displaying an annual population growth rate of merely around 0.5 percent in recent years. Nevertheless, compared to the world population in total, China held a share of about 19 percent of the overall global population in 2010. China's aging population In terms of demographic developments, the birth control efforts of the Chinese government had considerable effects on the demographic pyramid in China. Upon closer examination of the age distribution, a clear trend of an aging population becomes visible. In order to curb the negative effects of an aging population, the Chinese government abolished the one-child policy in 2015, which had been in effect since 1979. However, many Chinese parents nowadays are reluctant to have a second or third child, as it is the case in most of the developed countries in the world. The number of births in China varied in the years following the abolishment of the one-child policy, but did not increase considerably. Among the reasons most prominent for parents not having more children are the rising living costs and costs for child care, growing work pressure, a growing trend towards self-realization and individualism, and changing social behaviors.

This inverse quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission, with a shift away from mass equilibrium that results in more asymmetric products) mechanism may provide a path to the island of stability if shell effects around Z=114 are sufficiently strong, though lighter elements such as nobelium and seaborgium (Z=102106) are predicted to have higher yields. Preliminary studies of the 238U+238U and 238U+248Cm transfer reactions have failed to produce elements heavier than mendelevium (Z=101), though the increased yield in the latter reaction suggests that the use of even heavier targets such as 254Es (if available) may enable production of superheavy elements. This result is supported by a later calculation suggesting that the yield of superheavy nuclides (with Z109) will likely be higher in transfer reactions using heavier targets. A 2018 study of the 238U+232Th reaction at the Texas A&M Cyclotron Institute by Sara Wuenschel et al. found several unknown alpha decays that may possibly be attributed to new, neutron-rich isotopes of superheavy elements with 104<Z<116, though further research is required to unambiguously determine the atomic number of the products. This result strongly suggests that shell effects have a significant influence on cross sections, and that the island of stability could possibly be reached in future experiments with transfer reactions.",A log-log plot of the enthalpies of melting and boiling in the use of the list .

20230304_152148,5,statistamultiColumn5487.png," With the conquest of the kingdoms Mercia in 827, King Egbert of Wessex became the first ruler of the Anglo-Saxon people. Since this time, there have been 68 rulers of England and (since 1707) Great Britain. The majority of these rulers have inherited their title and crown from their mother or father, or as a result of their family ties, although some of the people on this list obtained their title through marriage or conquest, while others simply made a claim to the throne that was not always acknowledged by their subjects. The longest serving of these rulers is the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, who has been the British monarch for over 68 years. The shortest reign on this list belongs to Lady Jane Grey in 1553, who had been named Edward VI's successor in his will, however Jane was deposed after just nine days by Edward's half-sister Mary I (Bloody Mary), and she was subsequently executed for treason at the age of 16. ","Early Ruling Houses This data begins in 827, when King Egbert of Wessex was the first ruler to be named ""Bretwalda"" (Britain-ruler), although his grandson, Alfred the Great, is regarded by historians to be the first widely-accepted ruler of England, after his defeat of the Vikings in the late 9th century. England was ruled mostly by the House of Wessex until William the Conqueror defeated Harold of House Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, marking the end of the Anglo-Saxon rule over England. Norman rule ushered in a new era of French influence in the British monarchy, and vice-versa. The next three centuries were dominated by the House of Plantagenet (which included the Houses of Lancaster and York, most commonly associated with the Wars of the Roses; Britain's bloodiest civil war). The Houses of Tudor and Stuart Arguably the most famous royal house, the House of Tudor, came into power in 1485, at the beginning of what we now call modern history. This house included Henry VIII, Mary I and Elizabeth I, whose lives have been widely publicized in popular culture, and it oversaw a period of heavy reform (and anti-reform). Following the Tudors was the House of Stuart, which oversaw most of the seventeenth century, however it was interrupted for a brief period in the 1650s. This interruption came as a result of Charles I's execution, where control passed from the monarchy to parliament, with 'Lord Protector' Oliver Cromwell (and later his son) at its head. The monarchy was re-established with the appointment of Charles II in 1660. The final Stuart was Queen Anne, who was the head of State during the Act of Union in 1707, which brought England and Scotland together as the United Kingdom. Until this point the monarchy of Scotland and England had a complicated history, with many monarchs acting as the heads of both states, however this act now brought these monarchies together. The Houses of Hanover & Windsor George I became the King of Britain following the death of Queen Anne in 1714, who died without any legitimate heir, and George was appointed as he was the closest non-Catholic with a claim to the throne (The Act of Settlement 1701 excluded Catholics from becoming the head of state). During the 18th and nineteenth centuries the monarchy gradually transformed into the more ceremonial role that it has today. The British Empire also expanded to all corners of the world during the reigns of the Hanoverians and Windsors, and the heads of state eventually became the king or queen of all of these dominions. The final Hanoverian was Queen Victoria, whose reign of 63 years and 217 days is the second longest on this list, and this time is commonly known as the Victorian period. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took over the monarchy following the death of Victoria in 1901, however their name was changed to Windsor in 1917, to avoid association with Germany during the First World War. Since 1952, Elizabeth II has been the Queen of Britain and the Commonwealth, making her the longest serving British monarch in history. She will be most likely be succeeded by her son Charles, Prince of Wales. ","This statistic shows the results of a 2015 survey among Mormon converts in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2014 to 2019 .
